Title: Statistical modeling for SNP based genotyping of Staphylococcus aureus subtypes from metagenome shotgun data

Description: Uses a binomial mixture model to describe the observed alternative allele (SNP) derived from prior comparative genomic analysis to estimate the proportion of 40 S. aureus subtypes in metagenome samples. The 2 main input files are the SNP pattern file that contains the position information on subtype-specific SNPs as well as SNPs shared by other subtypes and coverage counts at these SNP sites, obtained by reference mapping of the reads to a reference genome. 
        A well-established two step method is used to estimate the proportion of serovar strain-specific SNPs present in pure or mixed infection of genotypes. First step is a direct estimate by using the sparsity of the design matrix. Quadratic optimization method is involved in the second step.  Originally developed for direct sequencing of C. trachomatis from clinical samples.
