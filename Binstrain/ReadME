Description: Uses a binomial mixture model to describe the observed alternative allele (SNP) derived from prior comparative genomic analysis to estimate the proportion of 40 S. aureus subtypes in metagenome samples. A well-established two step method is used to estimate the proportion of serovar strain-specific SNPs present in pure or mixed infection of genotypes. First step is a direct estimate by using the sparsity of the design matrix. Quadratic optimization method is involved in the second step.  Originally developed for direct sequencing of C. trachomatis from clinical samples.
